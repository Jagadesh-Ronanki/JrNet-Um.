# H-01. Unbounded Growth in Pending Stakes Array allows to grief and break liquidationPool operations

### Summary
The `increasePosition` function in LiquidationPool.sol allows any stake amount, leading to the creation of new stakes in the `pendingStakes[]` array. These pending stakes undergo processing the day after staking through `consolidatePendingStakes()`. The function is triggered on every increasePosition, decreasePosition, and distributeAssets call. Exploiting this, a malicious actor can repeatedly transfer minuscule amounts (1 wei) of EUROs / TST tokens, causing an infinite increase in the length of the pending stakes array. This manipulation results in excessive gas consumption or reverts during subsequent interactions.

```javascript
    // File: LiquidityPool.sol
    function increasePosition(uint256 _tstVal, uint256 _eurosVal) external {
        ...
        if (_tstVal > 0) IERC20(TST).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tstVal);
        if (_eurosVal > 0) IERC20(EUROs).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _eurosVal);
@>      // @audit allowing any amt of stakes result in grief other users - cost to perform attack is gas fee and very few asset tokens
        pendingStakes.push(PendingStake(msg.sender, block.timestamp, _tstVal, _eurosVal));
        ...
    }
```

### Vulnerability Details
1. Attacker mints 1 EUROs token from Vault.
2. Calls increasePosition with 1 wei, repeating the process multiple times (e.g., 1^18 times).
3. The `consolidatePendingStakes` function, which is gas-intensive, processes the pending stakes.
   - Iterates through pending stakes.
   - Deletes processed pending stakes by left-shifting elements in the array.
4. Interactions with decreasePosition, distributeAssets, or increasePosition on the following day lead to reverts or significant gas consumption.

### Impact
The vulnerability results in failed or excessively gas-consuming interactions, affecting the liquidity pool.

### Tools Used
Manual Review

### Recommendations
Implement checks to ensure that stake amounts are within reasonable limits, preventing abuse with extremely small values.

# M-01. Risk of reward loss due to deletions in the holders array, impacting liquidity stake-holders

### Summary
In the LiquidityPool contract, when a liquidity holder withdraws their entire staked amount from the pool, the corresponding position is deleted from the positions mapping, and the holder is removed from the holders array. However, a flaw in the logic exists: positions that are still pendingStake processing after this withdrawal action (entire stake removal) are not considered for reward distribution. This oversight results in potential loss of rewards for affected positions.

`empty()`: Checks for stake in the existing positions of the caller.
```javascript
    // File: LiquidationPool.sol
   function empty(Position memory _position) private pure returns (bool) {
      return _position.TST == 0 && _position.EUROs == 0;
   }
```

`deleteHolder()`: deletes the holder from holders array. 
```javascript
   // File: LiquidityPool.sol
   function deleteHolder(address _holder) private {
      ...
      holders.pop();
   }
```

`consolidatePendingStakes()`: Never checks for holder existence in holders array. Which is essential to spread and claim reward tokens.
```javascript
   // File: LiquidityPool.sol
    function consolidatePendingStakes() private {
        ...
        positions[_stake.holder].holder = _stake.holder;
        positions[_stake.holder].TST += _stake.TST;
        positions[_stake.holder].EUROs += _stake.EUROs;
        deletePendingStake(uint256(i));
        ...
    }
```

### Vulnerability Details
1. Scenario:
    * User 1 opens a new position with 10 TST.
    * The position is processed the next day.
2. Scenario:
    * On the second day, User 1 opens several new positions by calling increasePosition, and they are sent to pendingStakes.
    * Assuming User 1 took another position with 10 TST.
    * User 1 wants to decrease the position by the amount of 10 TST (available to redeem as processed from pending to positions).
3. Outcome:
    * User 1 assumes that they held a position at LP and earned rewards.
    * But on the decrease position call, User 1 deleted their address from `holders`.
    * To receive and claim rewards, the code holds the logic to iterate through the `holders` array.
```javascript
    // File: LiquidityPool.sol
    function distributeFees(uint256 _amount) external onlyManager {
        ...
            /*
                Iterates through the list of holders and calculates the portion of fees each holder
                is entitled to based on their TST holdings. The result is added to their EUROs balance
                in their respective positions.
            */
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < holders.length; i++) {
                // @audit User-1 never existed
                address _holder = holders[i];
                positions[_holder].EUROs += _amount * positions[_holder].TST / tstTotal;
            }
        ...
    }
```
4. Result:
    * User 1 never acquired rewards for this holding.

```

Sample Result:
```bash
  LiquidationPool
    bad position

  BigNumber { value: "10000000000000000000" },
  BigNumber { value: "0" },
  holder: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266',
  TST: BigNumber { value: "10000000000000000000" },
  EUROs: BigNumber { value: "0" } @> // no rewards earned on stake
]
      ✔ delete holder with existing position (555ms)
```
</details>

### Impact
This is an edge case where a stake-holder assumes to be receiving rewards on their stake but doesn't. Stake-holders fail to receive rewards until they call the increasePosition function which is as rare action as the cause to vulnerability.

### Recommendations
If holder holds pending stakes return `false`.

```diff
   // File: LiquidationPool.sol
   function deleteHolder(address _holder) private {
+     // Check if there are pending stakes for the holder
+     (uint256 _pendingTST, uint256 _pendingEUROs) = holderPendingStakes(_holder);
+     if (_pendingTST > 0 || _pendingEUROs > 0) {
+       // If there are pending stakes, do not delete the holder
+       return;
+     }
+
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < holders.length; i++) {
         if (holders[i] == _holder) {
            holders[i] = holders[holders.length - 1];
            holders.pop();
         }
      }
   }
