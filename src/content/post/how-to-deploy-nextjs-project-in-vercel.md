## Introduction


Next.js is a popular React framework that helps you build server-side rendered (SSR) applications. Vercel, formerly known as Zeit, is a cloud platform that allows for easy deployment of your web applications. In this blog post, we will discuss how to deploy a Next.js project in Vercel.


## Setting up a Vercel account


Before we start deploying our Next.js project, we need to have a Vercel account. If you don't have one, you can create a free account at [vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup). Once you have created your account, you can log in to the Vercel dashboard.


## Deploying a Next.js project in Vercel


To deploy a Next.js project in Vercel, the first step is to connect your project to Vercel. You can do this by logging in to your Vercel dashboard and clicking on the "New Project" button. From there, you can choose your project directory and Vercel will automatically detect that it is a Next.js project.


Once your project is connected, you can customize your deployment settings such as choosing the branch to deploy and setting environment variables. After configuring your settings, click on the "Deploy" button and Vercel will start building and deploying your project.


After the deployment is complete, you will be given a URL where you can view your deployed Next.js application. You can also configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your project in the Vercel dashboard.


## Conclusion


Deploying a Next.js project in Vercel is a simple process that can be done in just a few clicks. With Vercel, you can easily manage your deployments and scale your applications without worrying about server management.
