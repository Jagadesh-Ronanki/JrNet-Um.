## Introduction


React Custom Hooks are a powerful way to reuse stateful logic across components in a clean and efficient way. With Custom Hooks, we can extract and share complex logic between components, reducing code duplication and making our codebase easier to maintain. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of Custom Hooks and provide a code example to demonstrate their power.


## What are Custom Hooks?


Custom Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic between components in React. They are Javascript functions that use Hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state and lifecycle events, and can be shared and reused across multiple components. Custom Hooks can be used to extract and abstract complex logic into reusable functions, making our code more modular and easier to test.


## Code Example


Let's take a look at a simple code example to demonstrate the power of Custom Hooks. In this example, we will create a Custom Hook called useCounter that manages a simple count state and provides methods to increment and decrement the count.


```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

export const useCounter = (initialCount = 0) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return { count, increment, decrement };
};

```


Now that we have created our Custom Hook, we can use it in any component to manage count state and provide increment and decrement methods. Let's take a look at an example usage in a component.


```javascript
import { useCounter } from './useCounter';

const Counter = () => {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

```


As you can see, by using our Custom Hook we have extracted the count state and increment/decrement methods into a reusable function, making our code more modular and easier to maintain.


## Conclusion


In conclusion, Custom Hooks are a powerful way to extract and share stateful logic between components in React. With Custom Hooks, we can create reusable functions that manage complex state and lifecycle events, making our code more modular and easier to test. By using Custom Hooks, we can reduce code duplication and make our codebase easier to maintain. I hope this blog post has been helpful in demonstrating the power of Custom Hooks in React.
